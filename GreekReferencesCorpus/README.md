Title: Reference identification, in greek law texts with use of regular expressions
Tsimpouris Charalampos, Kyriakos Sgarbas
Abstract: In this paper, we present the construction of an autonomous identification referencing platform in Greek
law texts, which was developed with the support of the Research Program Caratheodory, 2010-2013,
of the Research Committee of the University of Patras, Greece. Legal citation is needed in every step of
studying legal texts, as it is used both by human and legal parsers for easy traversal through legal
databases, creating connection graphs and even maintaining existing laws. Even there has been
development in other languages, the analysis showed the lack in this area of expertise, in Greek legal
texts. In order to proceed with the construction of the autonomous system, we created a group of
regular expressions, that can identify as most as possible of a list of occurrences, after creating a
database for this purpose. In particular, we selected 14 documents, with different kind of legal texts, and
exported manually all citations to other legal documents. A database was constructed with 796 citations,
on which all regular expressions were based. The analysis showed the significant lack of
standardization, as a generalized issue among all kind of legal documents, based at the fact of various
ways of writing citations.
