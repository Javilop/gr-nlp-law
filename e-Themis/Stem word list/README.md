eThemis.stemlist
=============

A simple list of all words found in e-Themis, after stemming.

There is one word per line, where the first word is the stemmed word and all the others in the same line are the words before stemming.

The idea of this was to evaluate the stemming results of the stem algorithm ( MSc Thesis of Georgios Ntais).
